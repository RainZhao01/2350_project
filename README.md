### What is this Project about

Our project is a software application that provides users with a way to balance out their dietary and physical lifestyles. By combining two key API's: the Tasty API and Exercises API users will have access to a variety of health and lifestyle choices for everyone to benefit from. The Tasty API allows users to display recipes, generate meal plans, create grocery lists, and educational nutrition facts. Saving the time and energy that would have been otherwise wasted on planning and research. Complementing that is the Exercise API which will provide alternatives to pre-existing workout plans and deliver informative demonstration videos. Given that our diets and physical health are closely intertwined, leveraging both APIs together is a great opportunity to streamline and create convenience for the average user. Pairing the Tasty and Exercises API’s together supplies users with detailed diets to meet their workout needs and vice versa. Creating a balance and convenience for users' physical health, dietary needs, and overall lifestyle.
